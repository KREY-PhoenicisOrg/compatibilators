## How to add a script

You clone, you branch, you git push, me merges

## Ethics of this repository
1 - Untested scripts will be merged as "testing" for them to be merged without "testing" you need to provide actuall results of the script with full phoenicis version.

2 - If script is blocked by issue in phoenicis -> make MR on phoenicis according to their rules if you want them to do the job for you else you fix it here.

3 - If you have usefull info about compatibility for a game provide a comment for it.

4 - None gives a single shit about who you are.. rape kids, eat cats, kill dolphins i don't fucking care -> your code is what matters.
